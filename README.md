# Terraria.Mod.SuperSeedSearch
Current (2024.02.06 at 1.4.4.9) state of the code.
Just for those who are interested how the mod works internally or want to try around with their own code modifications.
Not suited for learning C# or modding Terraria.
Much better than the 1.3.5 version but still contains some old code from my very first C# and modding trials.
You will find some top-notch bad coding styles.
Needs some refactoring but no time for it.
